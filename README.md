# Chart.js Plugin as a framework-agnostic JavaScript plugin
# Core Functionality for Mean And Median.
<br>
I decided to tackle this assessment by trying to create a framework-agnostic Javascript, that could work without the need of context of a framework.
<br>
For the first part of this assessment you can find the code in the folder <strong> first_option </strong>

## Chart-js-component

This file shows how to manipulate Chart js by attempting to create a Javascript plugin

### Getting Started
Get started by downloading the content of this repo. There are two main files of concert. <strong> chart-js-component.js </strong> and <strong> index.html </strong>
Link the js file, and have the boiler plate from the html file for this to work. 
<br>
You will see in the index.html file, a script space for the assignation of the url

### Using the plugin
The plugin works by creating a table to display the information, and creating graphs as per the use of the data

### Documentation / comments 
I left many comments along the code to explain the steps taking on each aspect of the process. 
<br>
I trully wanted to create the plugin in a dynamic way, so the information can be render from any url, and the graphs will display the information as such.
<br>
I have no included any validations regarding the url, as this is more of a general approach as to how I will try to create the plugin, rather than a code ready for shipping.
<br>
As in right now I am able to render the information on a table, and able to graph it using the user's input as to the type of graph.
